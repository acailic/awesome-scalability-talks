## Introduction

Scott Correa, a Technical Program Manager at Dropbox, discusses the company's journey towards improving reliability and scalability. He emphasizes the importance of being "worthy of trust" in their business model, which revolves around storing and providing access to user data.

## Background

Dropbox started as a solution to the problem of data accessibility, growing rapidly from 1 million to 400 million users. As the company expanded, the infrastructure team faced challenges in managing reliability and incident response.

## Key Components of Reliability

1. **Durability**: Ensuring data is not lost or corrupted.
2. **Availability**: Making sure services are operational and accessible.
3. **Performance**: Delivering data in a timely manner.

## Challenges Faced

As Dropbox grew, the old incident management model became less effective. The team realized they needed to improve their incident response and standardize reliability across different teams.

## Incident Management Improvements

- **Sub-process**: Introduced a structured approach to incident management, categorizing incidents by severity (Sub 0 to Sub 3).
- **Training**: Developed a program for incident managers to ensure effective responses during incidents.
- **Post-Mortems**: Shifted from ad-hoc reviews to structured reliability reviews to learn from incidents and improve processes.

## Scaling Reliability

- **Critical Systems**: Defined critical systems that impact user experience and established reliability expectations for them.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Used data from incidents to identify trends and improve overall reliability.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implemented a scorecard system to track reliability metrics and foster accountability.

## Conclusion

Dropbox's journey towards scalability and reliability emphasizes the importance of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. The company encourages others to start small, focus on critical reliability aspects, and iterate on their processes.
