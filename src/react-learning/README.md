This documentation is designed to be read sequentially, as each concept builds on previous ones. However, you can also jump to specific sections if you need to review particular topics.

Each topic includes:

- Simple explanations with practical examples
- Code snippets showing the concept in action
- Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid

## Learning Path Recommendation

1. **First week**: Read introduction and fundamentals, build a simple app using just components, props, and state
2. **Second week**: Learn hooks in depth and refactor your app to use them
3. **Third week**: Focus on component lifecycle, rendering optimization, and performance
4. **Fourth week**: Explore different state management approaches and determine what fits your needs

Remember that practice is essential - build small projects to reinforce your understanding of each concept!
